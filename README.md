# 💎 Diamond Price Prediction – FastAPI Demo

This project is a full-stack machine learning demo application that predicts **diamond prices** based on physical and categorical features.  
The main focus of this project is **deploying a trained machine learning model as a web application** using FastAPI.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The workflow of the project is as follows:

1. A regression model was trained in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. The trained model was saved and loaded into a FastAPI backend.
3. A simple HTML + Bootstrap frontend collects user inputs.
4. The backend processes the input data and returns a predicted diamond price.
5. The result is displayed dynamically on the web interface.

This project demonstrates **real-world ML deployment challenges**, including preprocessing mismatches between training and inference.
